# Problem 1

In this problem we will look at a portion from the Tokyo rainfall dataset, which contains daily rainfall from 1951 to 1989. We consider a response to be whether the amount of rainfall exceeded 1mm over the given time period:
\begin{equation}
y_t|x_t \sim \text{Bin}(n_t, \pi (x_t)), \; \pi (x_t) = \frac{\exp (x_t)}{1 + \exp (x_t)} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp (-x_t)},
\end{equation}
